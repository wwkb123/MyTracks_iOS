# Problem
- It was noticed that the New York City has a relatively high rate of carbon emission
- Greenhouse gas emissions per person: 7.1 tons1
- Cars, buses, Subway, buildings, power plants…
- However, people do not really know how much carbon do they emit every day

#Solution
- We have developed an app to record tracks and display statistics e.g. daily carbon emission of the users
- To visualize users’ contribution to the carbon emission of the city
- To encourage New Yorkers to do more exercise and reduce carbon emission
- Users can also see their paths on the map, and statistics such as total distance, calories burnt and equivalent used of bulbs
- Useful for the government’s research/survey on carbon emission of the city
- Available for both Android and iOS platforms
